              <li class="fragment fade-up">The moths fly towards the light and once they hit it they 
              faint because they do not expect to hit what they thought to be 'the Moon'</li><br>
              <li class="fragment fade-right">The moths fall down onto the angled sheets of plastic
              and they fall through the gap into the body of the trap</li><br>
